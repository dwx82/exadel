In the first step I`ll check the Internet connection,packet loss and verify typed credintials such as: IP or hostname, port (if custom), login and password (passprhase in case of using key). If I used the hostname to connect to the server I`ll try to connect by IP, if it will successful then I`ll check DNS (service status,flush DNS, reboot the router...). 
On the server side I`ll check ssh service status, logs,config (maybe someone "helped" me) and IP (providers like to change it without notification)
I`ll also check the firewall polices on the PC,router and server.
When i run out of ideas I`ll google. I am sure that 99% of issues were resolved by someone and he wrote an article about it)
The sequence of steps depends on the recieved error and the network configuration on the server side.
Too little incoming data. Is it a phisical server, vm or conteiner ? Is it placed in a datacentre, serverroom or at home ? There are too many factors and too many ways to resolve the issue to describe them all.
